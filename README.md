# Bot Builder Application  

## Overview  
This project is a canvas-based bot builder application that allows users to design, test, and deploy chatbot workflows interactively. It offers a React Flow-like user interface for seamless workflow creation and supports customizable nodes and edges for dynamic chatbot design.  

---

## Features  

### 1. Customizable Nodes and Edges  
- **Node Types:**  
  - **Message Node:** Configurable messages to display to the user.  
  - **Option Node:** Buttons with the ability to add multiple options dynamically.  
  - **Condition Node:** Define multiple conditions using variables (e.g., `{user_name}`).  

### 2. Dynamic Workflow Design  
- Drag and drop interface for creating and connecting nodes.  
- Support for edge drawing between nodes to define bot flows.  
- Real-time visual feedback during node and edge modifications.  

### 3. Testing Environment  
- Built-in functionality to test and preview bot workflows.  
- Debug and refine workflows directly in the application.  
  

### 4. Framework Preference  
- Built using **React** with a React Flow-like library for canvas-based UI development.
